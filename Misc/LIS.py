# Longest Increasing subsequence

# Dynamic Programming Approach of Finding LIS by reducing the problem to longest common Subsequence

def lis(a):
	n=len(a)
	# Creating the sorted list
	b=sorted(list(set(a)))
	m=len(b)
	
	
	# Creating dp table for storing the answers of sub problems
	dp=[[-1 for i in range(m+1)] for j in range(n+1)]
	
	# Finding Longest common Subsequence of the two arrays
	for i in range(n+1):
			
		for j in range(m+1):
			if i==0 or j==0:
				dp[i][j]=0
			elif a[i-1]==b[j-1]:
				dp[i][j]=1+dp[i-1][j-1]
			else:
				dp[i][j]=max(dp[i-1][j],dp[i][j-1])
	return dp[-1][-1]
